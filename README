The graphical background is now re-sizable and stored in an SVG (in fact each image is stored in a different layer in the same .SVG)

Because Touchy always shows the DRO I have removed the DRO from the embedded tabs.

Touchy uses a physical cycle-start button, so I have added a HAL pin to the embedded tabs and hidden the buttons on the tabs (the action buttons are still where the G-code calls are stored, the physical button is made to emit a click event). If anyone wants the touch-buttons then it should only be a case of making the buttons visible. This might mean adding a parent window such as an event box.

Number-entry is now via a pop-up keyboard. I made a custom one to keep the option to type inch fractions (typing 1.3/4 will give 1.750)
